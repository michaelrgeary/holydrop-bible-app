📝 Search & Performance Test Instructions:

1. SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/genesis/1
   - Press "/" to focus the search bar (keyboard shortcut)
   - Type "beginning" - should find Genesis 1:1
   - Try toggling between "This Chapter" and "Whole Bible"
   - Click on a search result to navigate to that verse
   
2. AUTO-COMPLETE:
   - Start typing "John" - should suggest "John" and "John 3:16"
   - Click on suggestions to see them populate

3. SEARCH PAGE:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/search
   - Search for "love" or "faith"
   - Use filters: All Books / Old Testament / New Testament
   - Check pagination for many results
   - Search history appears when no query

4. VIRTUAL SCROLLING:
   - Open a long chapter (e.g., Psalm 119 when available)
   - Scroll smoothly - only visible verses render
   - Check DevTools > Performance > Memory usage
   - Annotation functionality still works

5. KEYBOARD NAVIGATION:
   - "/" to focus search
   - ESC to close search results
   - Arrow keys to navigate results
   - Enter to select

6. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - ✅ FlexSearch indexes all verses on load
   - ✅ Virtual scrolling for long chapters (>30 verses)
   - ✅ Lazy-loaded annotation sidebar
   - ✅ Memoized verse components
   - ✅ Debounced search input (300ms)
   
WATER THEME FEATURES:
